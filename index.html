    </ul>

<br>

<h3>Advanced Classes:</h3>
<h4>Spanish III:</h4>
    <p> Students will continue to enhance their communicative competency in the Spanish language through a variety of interpersonal, interpretive and presentational target language tasks. Authentic resources and language exercises will be used to develop listening, reading, speaking, and writing skills at the advanced novice level. Students will also increase cultural awareness of Hispanic communities through the exploration of diverse topics including travel, the culinary arts, entertainment, and cultural traditions in the Spanish-speaking world.</p>

<br>

<h4>Honors Geometry:</h4>
    <p> This course is an in-depth study of the concepts of Geometry in two and three dimensions. Topics include measurement, formulas, coordinate geometry, similarity, logic, proof and trigonometry. Concepts will be studied in the context of applications, concrete demonstrations, and connections to Algebra. Continuation in this course is contingent upon receiving a passing grade the previous trimester.</p>

<br>

<h4>Honors English:</h4>
    <p> English 9 creates the foundation upon which future high school reading, writing, and speaking skills will be built. The course will include experiences in both writing and reading workshops. Students will engage in the writing process to practice and build strong composition skills in mechanics and organization, to increase their command of language and vocabulary, to develop several multi-paragraph essays in a variety of modes, and to learn how to research. Students will also increase their capacity to critically comprehend multiple texts in both fiction and nonfiction through various reading workshops. In addition, students will become more effective communicators by developing skills in both speaking and listening. Honors English 9 addresses the same standards as English 9 at an accelerated rate with expanded literary, writing and speaking experiences.  This course provides the foundation for continued honors-level offerings that highly motivated students may choose in the future, including Honors Literature 10, Advanced Placement Language and Composition (11) and Advanced Placement Literature and Composition (12).  <b> Summer reading to maintain momentum and broaden perspectives is strongly encouraged.</b></p>

<br>

<h4>Honors Science:</h4>
    <p> This course is a laboratory approach to Earth Science including Physical Science and the Nature of Science and Engineering. Units of study will include: The Nature of Science and Engineering, Earth’s Systems and Cycles, Vermillion River Field Study, Earth’s Matter, Earth’s Energy, Plate Tectonics, Earth History, Astronomy and Climate. Human’s impact on Earth’s systems is examined in several units throughout the year. Emphasis will be placed on using the scientific method and the engineering design process and communicating the results through formal laboratory write-ups.</p>
    <p><b>*Note:</b> As an honors class, students will be required to work independently and in cooperative groups, to complete a significant amount of research, along with studying and reviewing the concepts covered. Most assessments include data analysis and constructed response questions that will help to prepare the student for more advanced science classes and college placement tests such as the ACT and SAT.</p>

<br>

<h4>AP World:</h4>
    <p> Knowing about your world is vital in understanding the people of the past and present. Advanced Placement World History offers an approach that lets students “do history” by guiding them through the steps a historian would take in analyzing historical events and evidence. Students will engage in field trips, artifact examination, debates, Socratic seminars and simulations. This course offers a global view of history from 1200 to the present that covers civilizations of the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. AP World History will fulfill the 11th grade history requirement and will help students succeed on the Advanced Placement exam.</p>
